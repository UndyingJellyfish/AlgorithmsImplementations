# AlgorithmsImplementations
This repo is where I mainly test my knowledge about algorithms and data structures by trying to implement them using a .NET platform. Currently everything uses .NET Framework 4.6.2 with C# 7.0.

These implementations are somewhat naive in most cases, and should probably be reviewed thoroughly before use in a production environment.

## Current projects
  1. Improving Binary Search Trees and properly implementing Red-black Trees, 2-3-4 Trees and B-trees.
  2. Writing tests and documentation for the existing codebase, specifically Minimum Spanning Trees, Quick Sort, Radix Sort and Longest Common Subsequence.
  3. Create a generic implementation of Dijkstras solution to the Single Shortest Path Problem using the existing Calculator<T> implementations.
