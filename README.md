# AlgorithmsImplementations
This repo is where I mainly test my knowledge about algorithms and data structures by trying to implement them using a .NET platform. Currently everything uses .NET Framework 4.6.2 with C# 7.0.

These implementations are somewhat naive in most cases, and should probably be reviewed thoroughly before use in a production environment.
